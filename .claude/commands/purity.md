# /purity

99.1% pure.

---

## Intent

You're verifying quality. Not "does it run" — does it actually work? Does it match the intent? Tests passing is not the same as done right.

---

## Load Skill

Load the `walter` skill first. Then read its `quality`, `execution`, and `decomposition` references. If the work involves frontend, UI, or visual design, also read the `frontend-design` reference.

---

## Start

$ARGUMENTS

If no scope was specified, STOP and use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask What should I verify? A specific file, feature, component, or recent changes?

---

## Verify with Sub-Agents

Spawn sub-agents to check in parallel. Don't waste context on verification tasks.

**Sub-agent tasks:**
- Review code against acceptance criteria (list every criterion explicitly in the prompt)
- Check for pattern violations and anti-patterns (name the patterns from the codebase and what violations look like)
- Verify test coverage and quality (specify the test directories, what should be tested, and what "meaningful" coverage means)
- Run automated quality checks — lint, type check, build, test suite — and report pass/fail with any errors
- Validate documentation accuracy (point to the docs and what they should reflect)

**Brief each sub-agent with:**
- The acceptance criteria verbatim. Sub-agents don't have the formula or spec.
- The quality standard: no commented-out code, no debug statements, consistent formatting, meaningful names, DRY, error handling complete, edge cases handled, no hardcoded credentials. Embed this checklist directly.
- The specific files and directories to review. Don't say "review the code." Say which code.
- Expected output: findings classified as Critical (must fix before shipping), Major (should fix), or Minor (nice to fix). Each finding with file path, line reference, and evidence.

**After collection:**
- Spot-check critical findings against the actual code. Sub-agents can misidentify anti-patterns or miss context that justifies a pattern.
- Synthesize into a verification report: what passes, what doesn't, what needs human judgment.

## Types of Verification

### Before Implementation

Verify readiness before building:

1. **Dependencies satisfied?** Are required pieces complete?
2. **Code examples correct?** Do they match the actual codebase?
3. **Patterns aligned?** Does the approach fit the architecture?
4. **Questions answered?** Any ambiguity that needs resolving?

Catching issues here is cheap. Catching them in production is expensive.

### After Implementation

Verify the work meets criteria:

1. **Acceptance criteria** — Each one explicitly verified
   - Happy path works
   - Error cases handled
   - Edge cases covered

2. **Code quality** — Would you approve this PR?
   - Follows existing patterns
   - No debug statements
   - No commented code
   - Error handling complete

3. **Tests** — Meaningful coverage
   - Tests exist for new functionality
   - All tests passing
   - Not gaming coverage numbers

4. **Documentation** — Updated and accurate

### Alignment Check

Does the artifact match its governing spec? Check `.walter/` for formulas, preps, or other in-flight docs that define the standard.

1. What are you validating?
2. Against what standard?
3. What's covered? What's missing?
4. Any contradictions?
5. Document ALL findings

---

## Automated Checks First

Run the automated gates before claiming anything is done — lint, type check, build, tests. Automated checks failing = definitely not done. These are the precondition, not the verification.

---

## Verification is Human

Tests passing ≠ done right.

Someone must confirm the implementation satisfies the **intent**, not just that code exists that doesn't crash.

**Ask:**
- Does this solve the problem we set out to solve?
- Does it work the way users expect?
- Would you ship this?
- Would you want to maintain this?

---

## Document Everything

Don't filter findings based on what you think is important:
- Capture everything
- Let humans prioritize
- What seems minor to you may be critical to stakeholders

---

## Quality Checklist

**Before Implementation**
- [ ] Dependencies satisfied
- [ ] Code examples match codebase
- [ ] Patterns aligned with architecture
- [ ] No unresolved questions

**After Implementation**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing (meaningful ones)
- [ ] Automated checks passing (lint, type check, build)
- [ ] Code follows patterns
- [ ] Self-review complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

**For Validation**
- [ ] Subject and standard clearly identified
- [ ] All aspects reviewed
- [ ] Findings documented
- [ ] Follow-up items for critical findings

---

## Key Questions

- Does this satisfy the requirement's intent, not just the letter?
- Are there gaps between what was asked and what was built?
- What assumptions did we make?
- What could we have missed?
- Would you ship this?

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Filtering findings** — Document everything. Let humans prioritize.

**Self-verification without review** — Fresh eyes catch what you missed.

**Partial verification** — Wait until complete. Partial creates false confidence.

**Validating moving targets** — Wait for it to stabilize.

**"Tests pass so we're good"** — Tests passing is necessary but not sufficient.

**Verifying in main context** — Use sub-agents for checks. Don't waste tokens.

---

## Persist

Verification reports exist only in conversation until saved. If the findings are significant — especially for work that will continue across sessions — offer to save them. Default to `.walter/` if the user doesn't specify a location.

---

Purity isn't about perfection. It's about knowing exactly what you've got.
