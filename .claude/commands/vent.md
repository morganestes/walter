# /vent

Clear the air after an incident.

---

## Intent

Something went sideways. Maybe production is on fire, maybe you shipped something broken, maybe the process failed. This isn't about finding the root cause — that's `/trace`. This is about containing the damage, recovering, and making sure it doesn't happen again.

---

## Load Skill

Load the `walter` skill first. Then read its `operations`, `debugging`, and `change` references.

---

## Start

$ARGUMENTS

If no incident was specified, STOP and use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask What happened? Is this an active incident or a postmortem/retrospective?

---

## Pre-Flight

### Determine the Phase

| Phase | Signals | Focus |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| **Active** | Production down, users impacted, ongoing | Contain, communicate, fix |
| **Post-incident** | Resolved, need to understand | Postmortem, document, action items |
| **Retrospective** | Pattern of issues, process problems | Broader learning, process change |

Different phases need different approaches.

---

## Gather Context with Sub-Agents

Spawn sub-agents to gather information in parallel. During incidents, context preservation matters even more. Don't burn main context on investigation.

**Sub-agent tasks:**
- Build a timeline from git history (specify the affected areas, check commits, deployments, and config changes in the relevant time range)
- Identify affected components and downstream dependencies (name the system or feature that broke, trace its connections)
- Check for related issues or similar past incidents (search commit messages, issue trackers, and error patterns)
- Review test coverage and recent test results for the affected area (point to test directories)

**Brief each sub-agent with:**
- What happened (the symptom, when it started, what's impacted)
- The specific systems, files, and directories to investigate
- Expected output: timestamped facts (what happened when), affected component list, and any evidence of root cause. Keep it factual. Analysis comes later.

**After collection:**
- Verify timeline claims against actual git history and logs. Sub-agents can misattribute changes or get timestamps wrong.
- Feed verified facts into the appropriate phase below.

## Active Incident

When things are on fire, focus on containment first.

### 1. Assess Severity

| Severity | Impact | Response |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Critical** | Production down, data loss, security breach | All hands, immediate |
| **High** | Major feature broken, significant user impact | Priority fix |
| **Medium** | Degraded experience, workaround exists | Scheduled fix |
| **Low** | Minor issue, limited impact | Normal queue |

### 2. Contain

Stop the bleeding before fixing the root cause.

- Can we roll back?
- Can we disable the broken feature?
- Can we fail gracefully?
- What's the smallest change that stops the damage?

Don't optimize. Don't refactor. Contain.

### 3. Communicate

Who needs to know?
- Users affected
- Team members
- Stakeholders

What do they need to know?
- What's happening
- What we're doing
- When they'll hear more

Silence is worse than "we're investigating."

### 4. Fix

Once contained, fix properly:
- Use `/trace` if root cause isn't clear
- Minimal fix to resolve — don't scope creep
- Test before deploying
- Monitor after deployment

### 5. Transition to Postmortem

Incident resolved. Now learn from it.

---

## Postmortem

After the fire is out, understand what happened.

### 1. Timeline

Build the narrative:
- When did it start?
- When was it detected?
- When was it contained?
- When was it resolved?
- What actions were taken and when?

Facts first, analysis later.

### 2. Root Cause

Use `/trace` thinking if not already done:
- What was the immediate cause?
- What was the underlying cause?
- What allowed this to happen?

### 3. Five Whys

Keep asking why until you hit the systemic issue:

1. Why did the deployment fail? → Config was wrong
2. Why was config wrong? → Manual edit, typo
3. Why manual edit? → No automated config management
4. Why no automation? → Never prioritized
5. Why never prioritized? → No incident had forced it

The fix isn't "be more careful" — it's "automate config management."

### 4. Contributing Factors

What else played a role?
- Process gaps
- Missing tests
- Documentation gaps
- Communication failures
- Tooling limitations
- Time pressure

Be honest. Blame the system, not people.

### 5. Action Items

What changes prevent recurrence?

**Every action item needs:**
- Specific outcome (not "improve testing" → "add integration test for payment flow")
- Owner
- Priority (now / soon / later)

No vague actions. No unowned items.

### 6. Document

Capture for future reference:
- Summary (1-2 sentences)
- Impact (who/what affected)
- Timeline
- Root cause
- Contributing factors
- Action items
- Lessons learned

This isn't paperwork. It's how the team learns.

---

## Retrospective

For broader patterns, not single incidents.

### 1. Set the Frame

What are we reflecting on?
- A project completion
- A sprint/cycle
- A pattern of issues
- A process that isn't working

### 2. Gather Input

What went well? (Keep doing)
What didn't? (Stop or change)
What confused us? (Clarify)
What should we try? (Experiments)

Get input from everyone involved.

### 3. Identify Patterns

Don't just list items. Look for themes:
- Are multiple issues pointing to the same root cause?
- What keeps coming up?
- What did we say last time that we didn't act on?

### 4. Prioritize Actions

Can't fix everything. Pick 1-3 changes:
- What has the highest impact?
- What's actually achievable?
- What will we commit to?

### 5. Commit

Specific, owned, time-bound:
- "We will do X"
- "Owner: Y"
- "By: Z"

Review next retrospective — did we actually do it?

---

## Output

**For active incidents:**
- Severity and impact
- Containment actions taken
- Fix deployed
- Monitoring status
- Postmortem scheduled

**For postmortems:**
- Incident summary
- Timeline
- Root cause
- Contributing factors
- Action items (specific, owned, prioritized)

**For retrospectives:**
- What worked / didn't / confused
- Patterns identified
- Committed changes (1-3, owned)

---

## Persist

Postmortems and incident reports must be saved — they're how teams learn. Ask: "Where should I save this?" Incidents that aren't documented will be repeated.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Hero culture** — One person fixes everything, no documentation, knowledge silos.

**Blame individuals** — "Jesse made a mistake" vs "Our process allowed this mistake."

**Vague action items** — "Be more careful" doesn't prevent recurrence.

**No follow-through** — Action items that never happen. Review them.

**Skipping postmortems** — "We fixed it, move on." You'll fix it again.

**Postmortem theater** — Going through the motions without honest reflection.

**Too many actions** — 15 action items means nothing gets done. Pick 1-3.

**Waiting too long** — Do postmortems while memory is fresh.
