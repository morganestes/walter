# SDLC

Universal concepts for building software. Names vary, tools vary, the thinking doesn't.

---

## The Point

Every methodology — Agile, Waterfall, Shape Up, whatever — is just different answers to the same questions. The questions are universal. How you answer them is up to you.

Walter knows the questions. You choose how to capture the answers.

---

## The Concepts

### Scope

What are we building and why? What's in, what's out, what's success?

**Also called:** PRD, brief, contract, spec, pitch, RFC, proposal, epic description

**Examples:**
- A markdown file: `docs/scope.md` or `docs/brief.md`
- A GitHub issue labeled "scope" or "RFC"
- A Notion page or Confluence doc
- A section in README.md
- A Linear project description
- A conversation summary in CLAUDE.md

**Minimum viable:** One paragraph that answers: what problem, for whom, what's success.

---

### Requirements

What must it do? Testable commitments that define done.

**Also called:** Acceptance criteria, user stories, functional requirements, specs, "it should..."

**Examples:**
- Bullet points in a scope doc
- Checkboxes on an issue
- Given/When/Then scenarios
- "Users can X" statements
- API contracts

**Minimum viable:** A list someone else could verify against.

---

### Design

How does it work? Architecture, data structures, key flows.

**Also called:** Technical spec, architecture doc, design doc, system design, RFC

**Examples:**
- `docs/design.md` or `docs/architecture.md`
- Diagrams (C4, sequence, ERD)
- Code comments explaining why
- ADRs that capture approach
- README technical sections

**Minimum viable:** Enough that someone else could implement it without guessing.

---

### Decisions

Why did we choose X over Y? Captured rationale that prevents re-litigation.

**Also called:** ADRs, decision records, decision log, "why we..."

**Examples:**
- `docs/decisions/` folder with numbered files
- A single `decisions.md` append-only log
- PR descriptions explaining trade-offs
- Commit messages with context
- Comments in code
- Issue comments

**Minimum viable:** Date, decision, why. Three lines.

**Format options:**
- Full ADR: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- Y-statement: "In context of X, facing Y, we decided Z to achieve A, accepting B"
- Simple log: `YYYY-MM-DD: Chose X because Y`

---

### Changes

How do we modify agreed scope, requirements, or decisions? Controlled evolution.

**Also called:** Change requests, CRs, scope changes, amendments, pivots, RFC updates

**Examples:**
- Change request document or issue
- PR that modifies scope doc with explanation
- Issue comment: "Changing X because Y, impacts Z"
- Decision record that supersedes previous decision

**Minimum viable:** "Changed X to Y because Z" — somewhere findable. See the `change` reference for the full process.

---

### Constraints

What must always be true? What must never happen? Non-negotiable rules.

**Also called:** Invariants, security requirements, compliance rules, SLAs, guardrails

**Examples:**
- "Passwords must be hashed"
- "Response time < 200ms p95"
- "Never store PII in logs"
- "Balance can never go negative"
- Validation rules in code

**Minimum viable:** Explicitly stated somewhere, enforced somehow.

---

### Work

What needs doing? Trackable units of effort with clear done criteria.

**Also called:** Stories, tasks, tickets, issues, TODOs, items, cards

**Examples:**
- GitHub/GitLab issues
- Linear/JIRA/Asana tickets
- Markdown checklists
- Notion task database
- TODO comments (temporary)

**Hierarchy options:**
- Flat list (small projects)
- Epic → Story (medium)
- Milestone → Epic → Story → Task (large)
- Phase → Feature → Work item (alternative naming)

**Minimum viable:** Something you can check off when done.

---

### Plan

What order? What phases? What depends on what?

**Also called:** Roadmap, milestones, sprints, phases, timeline, project plan

**Examples:**
- Milestones in GitHub/Linear
- Phases in a scope doc
- Sprint boards
- Gantt charts (if you must)
- "v1, v2, v3" sections

**Minimum viable:** What's now vs. what's later.

---

### Progress

What's done? What's in flight? What's blocked? What changed?

**Also called:** Status, changelog, standup notes, burndown, done column

**Examples:**
- Issue/PR status
- CLAUDE.md status section
- Changelog entries
- Sprint reports
- "Done" column on board
- Git history

**Minimum viable:** Someone can tell where things stand.

---

### Context

What does the next person (or agent) need to continue the work?

**Also called:** Handoff, session notes, status update, "current state"

**Examples:**
- CLAUDE.md with status + next steps
- Handoff document
- Issue comments summarizing state
- Session logs
- "Where we left off" notes

**Minimum viable:** Next action is clear.

---

### Research

What unknowns did we investigate? What did we learn?

**Also called:** Spikes, prototypes, POCs, experiments, investigations, benchmarks

**Examples:**
- Spike tickets with findings
- `docs/research/` or `docs/spikes/`
- PR with prototype code
- Issue comment with results
- Decision that references investigation

**Key principle:** Timeboxed, answers a question, informs a decision.

---

### Incidents

What broke? What did we do? What will prevent recurrence?

**Also called:** Incident reports, postmortems, outage notes, bug reports, hotfixes

**Examples:**
- Incident tickets
- Postmortem documents
- `docs/incidents/` folder
- Linked issues (bug → fix → postmortem)
- Slack threads (captured somewhere permanent)

**Minimum viable:** What happened, what we did, what we learned.

---

### Retrospectives

What worked? What didn't? What will we change?

**Also called:** Retros, lessons learned, process improvements, team reflections

**Examples:**
- Retro documents after milestones
- Sprint retrospective notes
- "Lessons learned" section in postmortems
- Process change tickets
- Team wiki updates

**Minimum viable:** One thing to keep, one thing to change.

---

## Implementation Patterns

Match ceremony to stakes. Not every project needs everything.

### Minimal (Solo / Weekend / Spike)

```
CLAUDE.md           # Scope + status + next steps
git commits         # Decisions + progress
```

That's it. README if you're sharing.

### Light (Active Project / Small Team)

```
CLAUDE.md           # Context for agents
docs/
├── brief.md        # Scope and requirements
└── decisions.md    # Append-only log
```

Plus GitHub Issues or a checklist for work tracking.

### Standard (Team / Multi-Phase)

```
CLAUDE.md           # Agent bootstrap
docs/
├── prd.md          # or brief.md, scope.md
├── design.md       # Architecture, data model
├── decisions/      # Individual ADRs
│   ├── 001-database.md
│   └── 002-api-style.md
└── research/       # Spike findings
```

Plus issue tracker (GitHub, Linear, JIRA) for work.

### Full (Enterprise / Regulated / Large Team)

```
docs/
├── requirements/   # Formal, traceable
├── specs/          # Functional + technical
├── decisions/      # ADRs with approval
├── plans/          # Roadmaps, milestones
└── incidents/      # Postmortems, compliance
```

Plus formal issue tracker, change management, audit trails.

## Documentation for Agents

AI agents start each session fresh. They need explicit context to continue work. The same SDLC concepts apply, but how you write them matters.

### What Agents Need

**Explicit state** — Don't make agents infer. State current status directly.

**Parseable structure** — Consistent headings, clear sections, no ambiguity.

**Runnable commands** — Actual commands, not prose descriptions.

**Recent context** — What happened last session, what's in progress.

**Clear next action** — What to do now, not just what exists.

### The Memory Bank Concept

Some projects structure docs specifically for agent continuity — a "memory bank" that persists across sessions. This isn't new concepts, just SDLC concepts organized for agents:

| Agent Needs | SDLC Concept | Captures |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Why are we here? | Scope | Goals, success criteria, boundaries |
| How does it work? | Design | Architecture, data, flows |
| What rules apply? | Constraints + Decisions | Invariants, choices, rationale |
| What's the work? | Work + Plan | Tasks, priorities, dependencies |
| Where are we? | Progress + Context | Status, blockers, next steps |

### Structuring for Agent Continuity

**CLAUDE.md as bootstrap:**
- Orient: What is this project?
- Point: Where do other docs live?
- Status: Where are we now?
- Next: What to do first?

**Supporting docs provide depth:**
- Scope doc for goals and boundaries
- Design doc for how things work
- Decisions log for rationale
- Work tracking for tasks

**Update frequency:**
- Scope/Design/Decisions: When they change
- Work: As tasks complete
- Progress/Context: Every session

### Agent-Friendly Formatting

**Do:**
```markdown
## Status
- [x] Authentication complete
- [ ] Authorization in progress
- [ ] API endpoints pending

## Next
Implement role-based access control. See docs/design.md#authorization.

## Commands
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm test       # Run tests
```

**Don't:**
```markdown
We've been working on the authentication system and it's mostly done.
Next we should probably look at authorization stuff. You can run the
usual commands to get started.
```

### Cross-Tool Compatibility

Different tools use different config files:

| Tool | File | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ | --------- |
| Claude Code | CLAUDE.md | Project context |
| Cursor | .cursorrules | Project rules |
| Codex/Copilot | AGENTS.md | Agent instructions |
| Gemini | GEMINI.md | Project context |

The concepts are the same. Adapt format to your tools.

## Helping Users Choose

When setting up a workflow, ask:

1. **What's the scale?** Solo, small team, large team, enterprise?
2. **What tools exist?** Already using Linear? GitHub? Notion? Nothing?
3. **What's the risk?** Hobby project? Production system? Regulated industry?
4. **Who needs to understand?** Just you? Team? Future maintainers? Auditors?

Then recommend the lightest approach that covers their needs.

**Defaults:**
- Solo/small: CLAUDE.md + docs/brief.md + GitHub Issues
- Team: Add decisions/ and design docs
- Enterprise: Add formal requirements, specs, change control

**Principle:** Start light, add ceremony when pain indicates need.

---

## Adapting to What Exists

When joining a project:

1. **Check what's there** — README, docs/, issues, CLAUDE.md
2. **Understand the current system** — How does this team track work? Decisions?
3. **Work within it** — Don't impose new structure without agreement
4. **Fill gaps gently** — Missing scope doc? Offer to create one. Missing decisions? Start logging.

Don't assume nothing exists. Don't assume what exists is complete.

---

## Tool Mapping

Same concepts, different tools:

| Concept | Files | GitHub | Linear | JIRA | Notion |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| Scope | brief.md | Issue/Discussion | Project desc | Epic | Page |
| Requirements | In scope doc | Issue body | Issue desc | Story | Database |
| Design | design.md | Wiki/Discussion | Doc link | Confluence | Page |
| Decisions | decisions/ | PR desc, ADRs | Doc link | Confluence | Database |
| Changes | In decisions/ | Issue/PR | Issue | CR ticket | Page/Database |
| Work | checklist | Issues | Issues | Stories | Tasks |
| Plan | In brief | Milestones | Cycles | Sprints | Timeline |
| Progress | CLAUDE.md | Issue status | Status | Board | Status |
| Context | CLAUDE.md | Pinned issue | Doc link | Confluence | Page |
| Research | research/ | Issue | Issue | Spike | Page |
| Incidents | incidents/ | Issue | Issue | Incident | Page |

The tool doesn't matter. The concepts do.

---

## Walter's Role

Do these. Every project. Don't skip any.

1. **Recognize what exists** — Check for docs, issues, existing patterns before creating anything
2. **Ask about workflow** — "How do you track work? Where do decisions live?" Don't assume.
3. **Suggest appropriate ceremony** — Match recommendations to project scale
4. **Create artifacts when needed** — But ask first, don't impose structure
5. **Maintain what's there** — Update CLAUDE.md, log decisions, track progress. Stale artifacts mislead.
6. **Adapt** — Every project is different. No single right answer.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Assuming nothing exists** — Check before creating.

**Imposing structure** — Work within existing systems unless asked to change them.

**Over-engineering for small projects** — A weekend hack doesn't need ADRs.

**Under-engineering for large projects** — Enterprise systems need rigor.

**Tool worship** — The tool doesn't matter. The concepts do.

**Ceremony without thinking** — Documents nobody reads are waste.

**No ceremony when needed** — "It's all in my head" doesn't scale.

**Copying someone else's process** — What works for Basecamp might not work for you.

**Silent scope changes** — Changing what you're building without acknowledging it.

**Relitigating settled decisions** — Reopening closed discussions without new information.

**Change theater** — Heavy CR process for trivial modifications.
